## BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS AND LAMBDA FUNCTIONS -Lambda Function to Multiply by 56 in Python

## Aim
To write a Python program using a lambda function that takes `z` as a parameter and returns `z * 56`.

## Algorithm
1. Begin the program.
2. Define a lambda function `double` that takes `z` and returns `z * 56`.
3. Read an integer value for `z` from the user.
4. Print the result by calling the lambda function.

## Program
```
double = lambda z: z * 56
z = int(input())
print(double(z))
```

### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus, the Python program was successfully executed using a lambda function to multiply the given number by 56 and print the result.
