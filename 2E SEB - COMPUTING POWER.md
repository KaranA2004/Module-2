## SEB - Input and Output of Integer and Float in Python

## Aim
To write a Python program that reads one integer and one float value, then prints the values.

## Algorithm
1. Begin the program.
2. Use `input()` to read an integer value and convert it to `int()`.
3. Use `input()` again to read a float value and convert it to `float()`.
4. Print both values using `print()`.
5. Terminate the program.

## Program
```python
a = int(input())
b = float(input())
print(a)
print(b)

```
### OUTPUT

### RESULT
Thus, the Python program was successfully executed to read one integer and one float value from the user and print both values.
