# Exp. No: 2a  
## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ PRINTING FACTORIAL OF A  NUMBERS

# Factorial Calculator in Python

## Aim
To create a Python program to compute the factorial for a given number using a `for` loop.

## Algorithm
1. Begin the program.
2. Use `input()` to read the value of `n` from the user.
3. Convert the input to an integer using `int()`.
4. Initialize a variable `factorial` with the value `1`.
5. Use a `for` loop to iterate from `1` to `n` (inclusive).
6. In each iteration, multiply `factorial` by the current value of `i`.
7. After the loop ends, display the result using `print()`.
8. Terminate the program.

### ðŸ§¾ Program

```import math
number = int(input())
result = math.factorial(number)
print(f"Factorial of the given number {number} is {result}")

```
